# Definition:- List of Elements of the same data type placed in a contiguous memory location.

# Creating an Array

-   datatype arrayName[ ] = new datatype[size];

# Array Nature:

1. Fixed Size – Arrays have a fixed size, meaning the number of elements is set at the time of creation and cannot be changed.

2. Indexed Access – Elements can be accessed directly using an index, starting from 0.

3. Homogeneous – All elements in an array are of the same data type.

4. Continuous Memory Allocation – Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, providing fast access.
