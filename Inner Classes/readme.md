# inner classes

-   In Java, inner classes are classes defined within another class. It's a way to logically group classes that are only used in one place, increasing encapsulation and making code more readable and maintainable.

# Types of Inner Classes in Java

1. Member Inner Class (Non-Static Inner or Nested Inner Class) :- Defined inside a class but outside any method, constructor, or block. Can access all members (including private) of the outer class.

2. Static Nested Class:

-   -   A nested class declared with the static keyword.
-   -   Does not require an instance of the outer class to be created.
-   -   Can access only static members of the outer class directly.
