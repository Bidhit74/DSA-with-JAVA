# What is Circular Linked List?

-   The circular linked list is a linked list in which all nodes form a circle. The initial and last nodes in a circular linked list are linked to each other, forming a circle. There is no NULL at the end.

# There are two types of Circular Linked List.

1.  Singly Circular Linked List:

-   -   The last node of a circular Singly linked list contains a pointer to the beginning node of the list. We go around the circular singly linked list till we get back to where we started. There is no beginning or finish to the circular singly linked list. There is no null value in the next section of any of the nodes.

2.  Doubly Linked List:

-   -   Circular Doubly Linked List has properties of both doubly linked list and circular linked list in which two consecutive elements are linked or connected by the previous. Next, pointer and the last node points to the first node by the next pointer and the first node points to the last node by the previous pointer.
