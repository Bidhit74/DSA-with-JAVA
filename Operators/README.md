# Operator in Java

-   Symbols that tell compiler to perform some operation

1. Arithmetic Operators: +, -,\*, /, % for mathematical operations.
2. Relational Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= to compare values.
3. Logical Operators: &&, ||, ! for boolean logic.
4. Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>> for bit-level operations.
5. Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, \*=, /=, %= to assign values.
6. Unary Operators: ++, --, +, - to increment/decrement or indicate positive/n. egative.
7. Ternary Operator: ? : for conditional expressions.
8. Instanceof Operator: Checks if an object is an instance of a specific class.

# Unary operator

1. Increment
    1. Post increment (Postfix) = p++; (increments after using the value).
    2. Pre increment (Prefix) = ++p; (increments before using the value).
2. Decrement
    1. Post Decrement (Postfix) = p--; (Decrement after using the value).
    2. Pre Decrement (Prefix) = --p; (Decrement before using the value).
